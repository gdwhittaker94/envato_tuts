    <!--? Idea behind this project: we could use a conventional grid a have x number of cols & rows and arrange all the elements so they fit into that grid. However, that means all the elements line up with each other and are even. The idea here is to use several grids on the same page in order to get an uneven and balanced yet still harmonious layout. -->

                <h4>OUR STORY</h4>
                <p>Founded in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Powderhorn was largely inspired by the dramatic Teton
                mountain range. Widely known as one of the most rugged and authentic areas for skiers and
                mountaineers, the ski slopes of Jackson served as the perfect testing grounds for sturdy
                and reliable gear.</p>

                <p>Powderhorn is inspired by the pure nature of Jackson Hole Wyoming. Our technical apparel
                is built with the mindset that using natural materials provides the best balance of
                functionality and longevity.</p>
